h1(#redmine-puma). Redmine Puma

h2(#description). Description

It uses the official "Redmine image":https://hub.docker.com/_/redmine/ as the base. Enhances the base in the following ways:

* runs "Puma":http://puma.io/ as a non-privileged user;
* accepts input configuration files to override the Redmine and Puma configuration, allowing for "Kubernetes config maps":https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#add-configmap-data-to-a-volume;
* includes additional plugins and themes;
* includes "piwik&#95;analytics":https://github.com/berkes/piwik_analytics;

h2(#updating). Updating

The files in @WEB_ROOT@ are updated with @rsync@ from the docker image. To avoid endless a loop of a restarting container a timeout for updating can be set in the variables @UPDATE_TIME_S@. No @rsync@ will be called if the restart time was less than this timeout. While @rsync@ should not write files that do not need to be updated, @rsync@ is still making read requests.
