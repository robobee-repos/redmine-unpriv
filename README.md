# Redmine

## Description

It uses the official [Redmine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redmine/) as the base. Enhances the base in the following ways:

- runs [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) as a non-privileged user;
- accepts input configuration files to override the Redmine and Passenger configuration, allowing for [Kubernetes config maps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#add-configmap-data-to-a-volume);
- includes additional plugins and themes;

## Environment Parameters
