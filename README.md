# Redmine Puma

## Description

It uses the official [Redmine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redmine/) as the base. Enhances the base in the following ways:

- runs [Puma](http://puma.io/) as a non-privileged user;
- accepts input configuration files to override the Redmine and Puma configuration, allowing for [Kubernetes config maps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#add-configmap-data-to-a-volume);
- includes additional plugins and themes;
- includes [piwik_analytics](https://github.com/berkes/piwik_analytics);

## Updating

The files in `WEB_ROOT` are updated with `rsync` from the docker image.
To avoid endless a loop of a restarting container a timeout for updating
can be set in the variables `UPDATE_TIME_S`. No `rsync` will be called if
the restart time was less than this timeout. While `rsync` should not write
files that do not need to be updated, `rsync` is still making read requests.

## Environment Parameters
